This is a **very important question**, and you’re right to slow down and really understand it. Once this clicks, **EDR, SIEM, and SOC triage** will make much more sense.

I’ll break this down **step by step**, without skipping logic.

# 1️⃣ What “Windows Event Logs” REALLY Means

**Windows Event Logs** is the **entire Windows logging framework**.

It includes:

* The logging engine
* The storage format (`.evtx`)
* All log channels

So when someone says:

> “Check the Windows Event Logs”

They mean:

> “Look at one or more event log channels inside Windows.”

---

## Windows Event Logs = The Logging SYSTEM

It is **not one log**
It is **not one file**
It is **not one viewer**

It is the **entire logging infrastructure**.

---

# 2️⃣ Core Windows Event Log Channels (Built-In)

These are logs generated by **Windows itself**.

### 🔹 Application

Generated by **applications**.

Examples:

* Application crashes
* Software errors
* App-specific warnings

Used for:

* App troubleshooting
* Some security signals (rare)

---

### 🔹 System

Generated by the **Windows OS**.

Examples:

* Service start/stop
* Driver failures
* System reboots

Used for:

* System health
* Uptime investigations

---

### 🔹 Security (Most Important for SOC)

Generated by the **Windows Security Subsystem**.

Examples:

* Logons (4624, 4625)
* Account changes
* Privilege use

Used for:

* Authentication monitoring
* Insider threat detection
* Compliance

⚠️ Requires auditing to be enabled.

---

### 🔹 Setup

Generated during:

* OS installation
* Updates
* Feature installs

Used for:

* Patch troubleshooting

---

### 🔹 Forwarded Events

Logs collected from **other machines** via **Windows Event Forwarding (WEF)**.

Used for:

* Centralized logging **without agents**

---

# 3️⃣ Where Sysmon Fits (This Is the Key Part)

### Sysmon is NOT a Windows Event Log channel by default

Sysmon is:

* A **Sysinternals tool**
* Installed manually
* Runs as a **Windows service**
* Extends Windows logging

---

## Sysmon Logs Are Still Windows Event Logs

This is the subtle but critical point.

Sysmon:

* Generates **its own events**
* Writes them into a **custom event log channel**

Path:

```
Applications and Services Logs
└── Microsoft
    └── Windows
        └── Sysmon
            └── Operational
```

So Sysmon logs are:
✅ Windows Event Logs
❌ Not native Windows Security logs

---

# 4️⃣ Core Difference: WHAT Gets Logged

This is the real distinction SOC analysts care about.

| Category                | Windows Security Logs | Sysmon Logs |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Who logged in           | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No        |
| Authentication failures | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No        |
| Account creation        | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No        |
| Process creation        | ⚠️ Limited            | ✅ Detailed  |
| Network connections     | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |
| Registry changes        | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |
| File creation           | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |
| Command-line arguments  | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |

---

# 5️⃣ Think in Questions (Best Way to Remember)

SOC analysts mentally ask:

### “Who accessed the system?”

→ **Security logs**

### “What process executed?”

→ **Sysmon**

### “What did that process do?”

→ **Sysmon**

### “Was authentication successful or not?”

→ **Security logs**

### “Did the system crash?”

→ **System logs**

---

# 6️⃣ Why SOCs Use BOTH (Never One Alone)

Example investigation:

1. **Security Log**

   * Event ID 4624 → User logged in
2. **Sysmon**

   * Event ID 1 → Suspicious process started
3. **Sysmon**

   * Event ID 3 → Network connection made
4. **Decision**

   * True positive → escalate

This correlation is **core SOC work**.

---

# 7️⃣ Why Sysmon Is a “Custom Log”

Sysmon logs are called *custom* because:

* They’re not generated by Windows by default
* They’re added by a third-party tool
* They still use Windows’ logging infrastructure

So:

> Sysmon logs are **custom Windows Event Logs**

---

# 8️⃣ Clean Mental Model (Memorize This)

> **Windows Event Logs = The platform**
> **Security logs = Who and access**
> **Sysmon logs = What and how**

---

# 9️⃣ One-Line Interview Answer

> *“Windows Event Logs refer to the entire logging framework in Windows, while Sysmon logs are custom event logs that provide detailed process, network, and registry telemetry beyond what native Windows logs provide.”*

## 🔗 How This Ties Directly to Your Projects

For your:

* **Sysmon + Wazuh EDR lab**
* **SOC triage playbooks**
* **MITRE ATT&CK mapping**

You’re doing exactly what real SOCs do:

* Native logs for identity
* Sysmon for behavior
* SIEM for correlation

If you want next, I can:

* Create a **visual diagram** of this flow
* Map **Security + Sysmon events to MITRE**
* Help you turn this explanation into a **LinkedIn knowledge post**
