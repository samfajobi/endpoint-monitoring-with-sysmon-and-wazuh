# Where Sysmon Fits (This Is the Key Part)

### Sysmon is NOT a Windows Event Log channel by default

Sysmon is:

* A **Sysinternals tool**
* Installed manually
* Runs as a **Windows service**
* Extends Windows logging

---

## Sysmon Logs Are Still Windows Event Logs

This is the subtle but critical point.

Sysmon:

* Generates **its own events**
* Writes them into a **custom event log channel**

Path:

```
Applications and Services Logs
└── Microsoft
    └── Windows
        └── Sysmon
            └── Operational
```

So Sysmon logs are:
✅ Windows Event Logs
❌ Not native Windows Security logs

# Core Difference: WHAT Gets Logged

This is the real distinction SOC analysts care about.

| Category                | Windows Security Logs | Sysmon Logs |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Who logged in           | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No        |
| Authentication failures | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No        |
| Account creation        | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No        |
| Process creation        | ⚠️ Limited            | ✅ Detailed  |
| Network connections     | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |
| Registry changes        | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |
| File creation           | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |
| Command-line arguments  | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes       |

# Think in Questions (Best Way to Remember)

SOC analysts mentally ask:

### “Who accessed the system?”

→ **Security logs**

### “What process executed?”

→ **Sysmon**

### “What did that process do?”

→ **Sysmon**

### “Was authentication successful or not?”

→ **Security logs**

### “Did the system crash?”

→ **System logs**

# Why SOCs Use BOTH (Never One Alone)

Example investigation:

1. **Security Log**

   * Event ID 4624 → User logged in
2. **Sysmon**

   * Event ID 1 → Suspicious process started
3. **Sysmon**

   * Event ID 3 → Network connection made
4. **Decision**

   * True positive → escalate

This correlation is **core SOC work**.

# Why Sysmon Is a “Custom Log”

Sysmon logs are called *custom* because:

* They’re not generated by Windows by default
* They’re added by a third-party tool
* They still use Windows’ logging infrastructure

So:

> Sysmon logs are **custom Windows Event Logs**

---

# Clean Mental Model

* Windows Event Logs = The platform**
* Security logs = Who and access**
* Sysmon logs = What and how**

---

# One-Line Interview Answer

> *“Windows Event Logs refer to the entire logging framework in Windows, while Sysmon logs are custom event logs that provide detailed process, network, and registry telemetry beyond what native Windows logs provide.”*
